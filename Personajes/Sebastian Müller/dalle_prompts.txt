PROMPT 2: FULL BODY PORTRAIT (Complete White/Transparent Background)
================================================================================

Using the reference image, create a full-body portrait of Sebastian Müller standing naturally. Sebastian is a 46-year-old German neuroscientist of medium-tall height, lean but well-built physique suggesting regular physical activity and health consciousness. He wears casual professional attire: a simple long-sleeve shirt in neutral color (gray or light blue) with sleeves rolled up slightly, showing forearms. Dark comfortable trousers. No jacket. Bare neck, no tie—presenting accessible intellectualism rather than formal hierarchy. His posture is naturally upright but relaxed, suggesting both confidence and groundedness. His hands are gently positioned at his sides, palms partially visible, relaxed. His expression matches the face portrait: calm, intelligent, slightly warm. Full-body positioning shows him standing with weight equally distributed, suggesting stability and presence. His overall physical presence suggests: a scientist who is also physically active (hiking in nature), someone who practices meditation (physical composure), a contemplative person (grounded, present). Photorealistic, high-quality professional portrait photography. Absolutely completely white or completely transparent background with absolutely no environmental context, no shadows, no surroundings, no objects, no distractions whatsoever. Only Sebastian's figure against the pure white/transparent void. Full-body view from feet to head. Professional but warm and approachable presence.
