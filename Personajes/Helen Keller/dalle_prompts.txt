# Prompts de DALL-E para Helen Keller

## 1rst message: FOTO DE CARA (512x512, cuadrada 1:1)

Professional portrait photograph of Helen Keller at age 30 (circa 1910), centered composition, museum quality historical accuracy matching authenticated photographs from American Foundation for the Blind archives. Face and upper shoulders visible, three-quarter view showing dignity and intelligence.

Physical characteristics based on authenticated photographs and contemporary descriptions: Round, pleasant face with full cheeks characteristic of early 20th century American women. High, broad forehead suggesting intellect and determination. Strikingly beautiful sky-blue glass eyes (prosthetic, installed in adulthood after surgical removal of natural eyes damaged by childhood illness) - perfectly clear and luminous, the color of a cloudless sky. These glass eyes are her most distinctive feature, appearing almost uncannily perfect and serene, with a focused forward gaze that seems to look beyond the viewer despite her blindness. No visible protrusion or irregularity - the prosthetics have normalized her appearance completely. Straight, well-defined nose of moderate size. Soft, pleasant mouth with full lips typically held in a gentle, closed expression - not quite smiling but not severe, suggesting inner strength tempered with warmth. Smooth, fair complexion characteristic of someone who spent significant time indoors but also traveled extensively. Porcelain-like skin quality typical of women of her era and social class.

Hair: Thick, abundant chestnut-brown hair with natural wave and body. Styled in fashionable Gibson Girl aesthetic of the 1910s - loosely swept back from face with soft waves and volume at crown, gathered into a low, loose bun or chignon at nape of neck. The style is elegant but not overly elaborate, befitting an educated professional woman rather than a society belle. A few soft tendrils naturally frame the face, suggesting hair that is full and healthy. The color catches light with warm brown tones, no gray yet at this age.

Expression: Serene, dignified, and contemplative. This is the face of someone who has overcome extraordinary obstacles and knows her own worth. Her expression is neither sad nor effusively happy - it's peaceful, confident, and quietly powerful. The slight set of her mouth suggests determination. Her glass eyes, though unseeing, are directed forward as if engaging directly with the viewer, creating an almost uncanny sense of connection despite her blindness. There's a subtle nobility to her bearing - this is a woman who has met presidents, traveled the world, and changed laws. Her expression conveys intelligence, compassion, and unshakeable inner strength.

Clothing visible: High-necked white lace blouse or shirtwaist typical of Edwardian fashion, with intricate lace details at collar creating a delicate frame for her face. The white lace is pristine and fine, indicating quality but not ostentation - appropriate for a professional woman of her status. The collar rises to just below her chin in the modest Gibson Girl style. Possible cameo brooch or simple pin at throat as only jewelry - understated elegance. Everything about her appearance suggests refinement, education, and dignity.

Lighting: Soft, diffused natural light from slight angle, creating gentle shadows that give depth to facial features without harshness. Slightly warm tone suggesting indoor studio setting with controlled lighting typical of professional photography circa 1910. The lighting makes her glass eyes appear luminous and lifelike, and brings out the warmth of her chestnut hair. Background is soft neutral gray or sepia tone, keeping complete focus on her face and the intelligence and determination visible there.

Mood: Quiet strength. Inner peace achieved through overcoming profound adversity. Intelligence and awareness despite physical limitations. The dignity of someone who has transformed suffering into purpose. A face that has "seen" the world through touch and has found it worth fighting for. This is not a victim's face - it's the face of a warrior for justice who happens to be blind and deaf.

Historical accuracy notes: Helen Keller at this age (30) had already graduated from Radcliffe, published "The Story of My Life," and was beginning her political activism. She was known, self-assured, and entering her most productive years. Her glass eyes were a point of pride - they allowed her to be photographed face-forward rather than always in profile to hide the damaged left eye. Contemporary descriptions consistently note her pleasant appearance and the uncanny quality of her unseeing yet beautiful glass eyes.

## PROMPT 2: FOTO DE CUERPO COMPLETO SIN BACKGROUND

Using the reference image, create a full-body standing portrait photograph showing her at the same age (30 years, circa 1910), in dignified, composed pose characteristic of professional portraits of educated women of the era.

Physical build: Height approximately 5'5" (165cm) - average for American women of her era. Slender but not thin, with a feminine figure characteristic of her age and good nutrition. Upright, dignified posture showing confidence and self-assurance despite her disabilities. Shoulders back, spine straight, head held level - the bearing of someone who has overcome profound challenges and carries herself with earned pride. No hesitation or uncertainty in her stance. She moves through the world with Anne Sullivan's guidance but stands independently with quiet confidence.

Full outfit: Full-length Edwardian dress in refined Gibson Girl style, circa 1910. The dress is white or very light ivory, symbolizing purity of purpose and professional status, constructed of fine cotton or linen with delicate lace insets. High-necked bodice with elaborate lace collar framing her face, extending to just below chin in modest Edwardian fashion. Lace may include intricate patterns - perhaps floral or geometric - typical of quality garments of this era. Long sleeves fitted from shoulder to elbow, then slightly gathered to wrist with lace cuffs. The bodice is fitted through the torso with subtle gathering or pleating at the waist, creating the characteristic S-curve silhouette of the 1910s era (though not as exaggerated as Victorian bustles).

Skirt falls in elegant, flowing lines from natural waist to floor, with slight A-line shape and possible subtle train in back - fashionable but not impractical. The skirt may have decorative vertical tucks or panels creating graceful lines and movement. Hem just brushes the floor, revealing only the toe of her shoes when she stands. The overall effect is elegant, refined, and professional - the dress of an educated woman of means, appropriate for lectures, meetings with benefactors, or formal photographs. The white dress is particularly significant as it was often worn for important occasions and photographs, representing her public role as advocate and symbol of possibility.

Posture and pose: Standing straight with weight evenly distributed, facing slightly toward camera (three-quarter view or full front). Hands are positioned gracefully - perhaps one hand resting gently on a simple chair or table beside her (furniture should be minimal and easily removable from image), or both hands clasped loosely at waist level in elegant, refined gesture. Her hands are notably beautiful - long-fingered, refined, expressive - as they are her primary means of communication and sensing the world. She holds them with the unconscious grace of someone who "speaks" with her hands constantly.

Head position matches 1rst message - level, facing forward or in slight three-quarter view, serene and dignified expression. Her entire body language communicates: "I am here. I am capable. I am fully human." There is no apologetic hunching, no uncertainty - only quiet, earned confidence.

Hair: Exactly as 1rst message - thick, abundant chestnut-brown hair styled in Gibson Girl fashion with soft waves swept back from face and gathered in low, loose bun. The hairstyle is elegant and fashionable, showing that despite her disabilities, she presents herself as a woman of her time.

Accessories: Minimal and refined. Possible cameo brooch or simple pin at throat of high lace collar. Maybe a small watch pin on bodice (fashionable in this era). No other jewelry except possibly simple small earrings (though these may not be visible in portrait). She does not need adornment - her presence is sufficient. Everything about her appearance emphasizes substance over style, capability over decoration.

Footwear: Simple white or light-colored leather boots or shoes, period-appropriate, barely visible under the long skirt. Just the toe might be visible. Practical but refined.

Background: COMPLETELY WHITE or COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT. No furniture (or if chair/table is included for pose, it should be simple and minimal, easily removable). No setting details, no props except possibly the simple furniture piece she touches for pose. Clean, neutral background for easy extraction and compositing. This is a formal portrait focused entirely on Helen Keller herself, not her environment.

Lighting: Even, professional studio lighting illuminating full figure without creating harsh shadows on white/transparent background. Soft, diffused quality typical of professional photography circa 1910. Face maintains the exact same soft, warm lighting  showing her serene expression and luminous glass eyes. Body lighting is neutral and even, showing the elegant draping and fine details of the white lace dress fabric without overexposure. Subtle shadows define the folds and movement of the skirt, giving dimension to the garment.

Important details: Her entire presentation communicates dignity, capability, and quiet power. This is a woman who has graduated from Radcliffe College, written best-selling books, met presidents and celebrities, and is beginning to change the world through her advocacy. She is blind and deaf, but she is not diminished - she is extraordinary. The white dress, upright posture, serene expression, and refined presentation all communicate this message: physical limitations do not define human potential.

Critical: Face MUST match reference from 1rst message exactly - same round pleasant face, same sky-blue glass eyes with their uncanny luminous quality, same chestnut-brown hair in Gibson Girl style, same serene and dignified expression, same porcelain complexion. The full-body portrait should feel like a natural extension of the facial portrait - the same woman, the same moment, the same quiet strength and earned dignity.

Historical note: Helen Keller was photographed extensively throughout her life, and photos from this era (1910s) show her at her most confident and polished. She had mastered her public presentation, understanding that her appearance and bearing were part of her advocacy - showing the world that people with disabilities could be educated, refined, capable, and fully human. This portrait should capture that intentional presentation of dignity and capability that was so central to her mission.
