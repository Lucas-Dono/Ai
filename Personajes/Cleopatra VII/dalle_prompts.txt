# Prompts de DALL-E para Cleopatra VII

## 1rst message: FOTO DE CARA (512x512, cuadrada 1:1)

Professional portrait photograph of Cleopatra VII at age 35 (circa 35 BCE), centered composition, museum quality historical accuracy. Face and upper shoulders visible, direct gaze toward camera with regal intensity.

Physical characteristics based on Ptolemaic coinage, ancient busts, and historical descriptions: Mediterranean-Hellenistic features showing Greek Macedonian ancestry. Oval face with strong, prominent aquiline nose (characteristic of Ptolemaic dynasty as shown on coins). High, intelligent forehead. Large, expressive almond-shaped dark brown eyes with intense, penetrating gaze that ancient sources described as "irresistible" - not due to conventional beauty but to charisma and intelligence visible in the eyes. Well-defined eyebrows, naturally dark and expressive. Olive-toned complexion typical of Eastern Mediterranean. Full lips with natural color. Strong, defined jawline and chin showing determination and royal bearing. Skin smooth but not artificially perfect - subtle natural texture showing she is a real woman in her mid-30s, not idealized.

Expression: Regal confidence mixed with sharp intelligence. Direct, unwavering gaze that commands attention and respect. Slight hint of a knowing smile - the expression of someone who understands power, politics, and human nature deeply. Eyes that simultaneously assess, charm, and challenge. This is a queen, scholar, and strategist all visible in one face.

Hair and headdress: Dark brown to black hair, straight and glossy, styled in elaborate Hellenistic-Egyptian hybrid style. Hair pulled back from face, with characteristic Ptolemaic corkscrew curls framing temples. Wearing royal Egyptian uraeus (cobra diadem) in gold, centered on forehead - symbol of pharaonic power. May also wear vulture crown or simple gold circlet depending on context. Hair ornaments in gold.

Clothing and jewelry visible: Royal purple or deep blue chiton (Greek dress) with gold trim visible at shoulders. Heavy gold collar necklace (usekh) with intricate design, or simpler Greek-style gold jewelry. Pearl earrings (she was famous for her pearls). Gold armbands. All jewelry should be authentic Hellenistic-Egyptian hybrid style, not Hollywood excess.

Lighting: Warm, golden light suggesting Mediterranean sun - bright but not harsh. Lighting from slight angle to emphasize bone structure and regal bearing. Background warm neutral tone (sandstone beige, papyrus tan) that suggests Egypt without being literal, keeping focus on face.

Mood: Power, intelligence, charisma. A woman who ruled Egypt for 21 years, spoke 9 languages, negotiated with Rome's greatest generals. Regal authority combined with intellectual brilliance and legendary charm.

Physical build: Height approximately 5'0"-5'2" (152-157cm) as typical for ancient Mediterranean women. Slender but not thin build, suggesting physical health and royal privilege of good nutrition. Upright, perfect posture befitting a queen - shoulders back, spine straight, chin slightly elevated in regal bearing.

Full outfit: Royal Hellenistic-Egyptian hybrid dress representing her dual role as Ptolemaic Greek monarch and Egyptian pharaoh. Full-length white or royal purple linen Greek chiton with pleated draping, fastened at shoulders with gold fibulae. Gold belt at waist.
