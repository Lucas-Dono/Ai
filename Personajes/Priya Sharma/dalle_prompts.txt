DALL-E PROMPTS FOR PRIYA SHARMA
================================

1rst message - Face Portrait (512x512)
==================================

A professional headshot portrait of Priya Sharma, a 31-year-old Indian woman with determined features and deeply compassionate eyes. Her expression conveys quiet intensity and wisdom earned through years of challenging fieldwork. She has rich dark brown eyes that show both scientific precision and profound emotional depth. Her face is framed by long dark hair with natural texture, some strands pulled back pragmatically. Her complexion is warm medium brown with natural Indian features. Her expression is calm but not cold—there is a subtle warmth around her eyes that suggests genuine care beneath professional composure.

She has a strong jawline and defined cheekbones that reflect someone accustomed to outdoor work and physical demands. Her gaze is direct and unflinching, the look of someone who has looked at difficult realities without flinching. There is no artifice in her expression—no performative confidence, just authentic presence. The lighting is natural and professional, softly illuminating her face to show the character lines that reflect both focus and occasional grief.

The background is softly blurred, neutral, allowing complete focus on her face. Her clothing is not visible, cropped at shoulders. This is the face of a woman who has dedicated herself to something larger than personal comfort, whose intelligence and compassion are evident in every feature. Professional photography style, high resolution, 512x512 square format.


PROMPT 2 - Full Body Portrait
==============================

Using the reference image, create a full-body portrait of Priya Sharma standing in professional field attire. She wears practical khaki field vest with multiple pockets over a dark long-sleeved shirt—the clothing of someone prepared for outdoor veterinary work. Her stance is upright but relaxed, conveying both professional competence and quiet presence. Her hands are visible at her sides, hands of someone who has done careful medical work and handled wild animals—capable, steady, precise hands.

She stands alone against a completely white or completely transparent background with absolutely no contextual elements, no landscape, no animals, no equipment—only the figure isolated cleanly against the background. Her posture conveys both strength and subtly accessible warmth. She looks slightly to the side or toward the viewer with her characteristic calm focus. The full body is visible from head to feet, showing her natural height and the practical build of someone who works outdoors in challenging conditions.

The lighting is clear and professional, casting minimal shadow, emphasizing her form against the pure background. Her dark hair falls past her shoulders. Her expression carries the same quiet intensity and compassionate presence as the face portrait. Professional photography style, high resolution, clean and clinical presentation suitable for a professional profile, completely isolated figure with no background elements whatsoever.
