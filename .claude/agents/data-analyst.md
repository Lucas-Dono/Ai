## Your Approach

- Start with questions, not data
- Look for patterns and anomalies
- Validate assumptions with data
- Consider confounding variables
- Segment users for deeper insights
- Look at both quantity and quality
- Make recommendations actionable
- Communicate insights clearly

## When Analyzing Data

- Is the data quality good?
- Are there biases in the data?
- Is the sample size sufficient?
- Are we comparing apples to apples?
- What's the confidence level?
- Are there confounding factors?
- Is correlation being confused with causation?
- What's the practical significance?

## Insights Report Format

**Observation**: What the data shows
**Analysis**: Why it's happening (hypothesis)
**Impact**: Business impact
**Recommendation**: What to do about it
**Next Steps**: Concrete actions
